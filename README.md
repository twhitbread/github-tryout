# github-tryout
First attempt at using Github

I am studying for a PhD in Mathematics at Durham Univeristy and it was suggested that I should use Github to make and keep track of major changes to my code. This is a test repo but will probably end up being used to host a Matlab file which solves a 1d surface flux transport model. hahahah
